# MIP Problem Set

MIP Problem Sets include cover instances and random MPD instances.

## 1. Cover instances 
The name of each file has the form "n_m_S.mps",
where
n is the number of variables,
m is the number of constraints, and
S is the number of instances with fixed n and m.

## 2. Random MPD instances
For Manufacturer's Mixed Pallet Design Problem, Q1 = 72, Q2 = 1.
The mixed pallet designs are chosen from all possible mixed pallet designs.
The name of each file has the form "rCNMT_P_S.mps",
where 
rCNMT corresponds to the data which comes from http://alpersen.bilkent.edu.tr/Mixed_Pallet/;
P is the candicate number of possible mixed pallet designs; and 
S is the number of instances with fixed rCNMT and E.
