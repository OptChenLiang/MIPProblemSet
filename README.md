# MIP Problem Set

MIP Problem Sets include cover instances and random MPD instances.

## 1. Cover instances 
The name of each file has the form "n_m_s.mps", where

n is the number of variables,

m is the number of constraints, and

s is the number of instances with fixed n and m.

## 2. Random MPD instances
For Manufacturer's Mixed Pallet Design Problem, $Q_1 = 72$, $Q_2 = 1$.

The mixed pallet designs are chosen from all possible mixed pallet designs.

The name of each file has the form "rcnmt_p_s.mps", where 

rcnmt corresponds to the data which comes from http://alpersen.bilkent.edu.tr/Mixed_Pallet/,

p is the candicate number of possible mixed pallet designs, and 

s is the number of instances with fixed rcnmt and p.
